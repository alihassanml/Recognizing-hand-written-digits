## Overview

This project focuses on recognizing hand-written digits from images using machine learning algorithms such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and others. The dataset used for training and testing is based on digit images, similar to the MNIST dataset, which is commonly used for digit recognition tasks.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Techniques to clean and prepare image data for model training.
- **Model Training**: Implementations of different machine learning algorithms, including Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines.
- **Model Evaluation**: Metrics to evaluate the performance of the trained models.
- **Visualization**: Visual representation of predictions to understand model performance.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alihassanml/Recognizing-hand-written-digits.git
   cd Recognizing-hand-written-digits
   ```

2. **Install the necessary Python packages**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Open the Jupyter Notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Naive\ Bayes\ Project.ipynb
   ```

2. **Follow the instructions in the notebook** to preprocess the data, train the models, and evaluate their performance.

3. **Modify the code** as needed to experiment with different algorithms or hyperparameters.
